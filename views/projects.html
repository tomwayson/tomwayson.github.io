<h3>Projects</h3><p>I plan to include a curated list of projects that I've contributed to. It's going to work like the <a ng-href="#/starred">Starred page</a>, where I query and filter repos from the <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/">GitHub REST API</a>.</p><p>In the meantime, can link directly to <a href="//github.com/tomwayson/">my GitHub profile</a> and see what I've been up to.</p>
